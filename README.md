## Description

Basic game I developed to test physics.

This is just a generic game and does not leads to anything (no highscore stored, no fancy animation...).

I use the game environnement to test the physics of games that have yet to come (multiples tests about what kind of curve feel the greatest to implement gravity, how heavy must the character be to feel pleasant to the player etc...).
Useful data is printed on screen to help debugging.
